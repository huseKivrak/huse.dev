## introduction

I've wanted to code magic tricks since printing my first `Hello, World!`.
If you know any magicians, you're aware of our propensity to make _anything_ into a trick:
rubber bands, receipts, lip balm, fruit... No object is safe.
And with programming, I discovered an infinite playground of possibilities.

'chat huh' is my first trick. I built it a few months after starting to code
(when that 'infinite playground' often felt more 'shoddy jungle gym').
It's my take on a classic trick: a series of predictions about a participant-shuffled deck of cards.
Traditionally, the predictions are written on paper;
here, they're made by an - ostensibly - psychic chatbot.

There weren't any templates or tutorials for "clairvoyant chatbot" (I checked),
and in developing 'chat huh' I encountered some interesting problems.
I had a blast throughout the process, cementing my love of programming.
This post is an overview of its development, and I hope reading it
inspires you to build something silly, too.

I recommend reading through first, but if you'd like to see 'chat huh' in action you can
[watch a demo](https://youtu.be/eZv5wb56MB0) of the version I performed while attending Rithm School.

<br />
But first, a quick look at TypeIt: a fun utility at the heart of 'chat huh'.

## TypeIt

TypeIt is a JavaScript typewriter utility by [Alex MacArthur](https://www.macarthur.me/).
It's easy to use, incredibly flexible, and just plain fun.
You can even [build custom animations without writing any code](https://www.typeitjs.com/build-your-own/).
How cool is that?

The [documentation](https://www.typeitjs.com/docs/vanilla/usage/) is fantastic. I'll just give a quick overview.

Each animation is a TypeIt instance with two arguments:

- **element**: where the text will be typed (use DOM or CSS selectors)
- **options** object: the instance behavior (string(s) typed, speed, etc.)

Assign it to a variable, and you have a ready-to-go animation,
triggerable anywhere in your code using the `.go()` method:

```js
const HAL = new TypeIt('#podBayDoors', {
  strings: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.",
  speed: 20,
});

HAL.go(); //chilling typewriting ensues
```

But the [instance methods](https://www.typeitjs.com/docs/vanilla/instance-methods/) are where the magic happens - literally, in this case.
They provide fine-tuned control at every step (and were actually my first exposure to [method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining)).

By adding some well-timed delays and edits, you can suggest a surprising amount of personality.

Here's how I used them to add a little drama and realism:

```js
const redsReveal = new TypeIt('#output', { speed: 25 })
  .pause(3000)
  .type('Of those face-down cards, ')
  .type('18 are red.', { delay: 3000 })
  .move(-9, { delay: 1000 })
  .delete(1, { delay: 1500 })
  .type('7', { delay: 2500 })
  .move(null, { to: 'END' });
```

## chat huh

If you have some coding experience, you likely have a sense of the general idea:

**An event handler calls `.go()` on subsequent `TypeIt`s with each form submission,
iterating through an array of predictions.**

And initially, yes, 'chat huh' was just a single-input form & a bunch of TypeIts.

But there was still some key functionality missing:

- **interactivity**: to be believable, it'd somehow have to be capable of communicating dynamically, not just recite stock lines.
  This one was daunting.
- **reusability**: it should be able to perform multiple tricks;
  new tricks shouldn't require their own chatbots.
- **toggling**: finally, if it's interactive & has a repertoire, it'd need a way
  to select tricks and toggle between 'chatting' & 'performing', discreetly.

Interactivity seemed definitively unachievable.
I obviously couldn't build an actual language model
and incorporating AI APIs was not yet on my radar.

The eventual solution was unexpectedly simple. It was the last feature I implemented,
though, so let's look at the others first.

## `class Trick`

I was learning object-oriented programming at the time,
and making a `Trick` class ticked a lot of boxes.

Each `Trick` could have a `patter` property (magician-speak for a trick's script),
which stores its array of `TypeIt`s,
and `patterShown`,
a counter variable that also served as an index.

```js
class Trick {
  constructor(patter) {
    this.patter = patter;
    this.patterShown = 0;
  }

  perform() {
    if (this.patterShown < this.patter.length) {
      const nextLine = this.patter[this.patterShown];
      nextLine.go();
      this.patterShown++;
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

And by assigning each trick a "secret code" property, `prompt`, I could discreetly
select a trick by using the prompt in the form input:

```js
const trick = repertoire.find((t) => input.includes(t.prompt));

if (trick) {
  return trick.perform();
}
```

I wanted prompts to be as inconspicuous as possible & decided to use
**punctuation marks**: they arose no suspicion and allowed me to chat freely,
without worrying about word choice.

Finally, a global variable `ACTIVE_TRICK`, to keep track of the selected trick
& toggle 'performance mode'.

Sprinkle in a little [jQuery](https://jquery.com), and `handleSubmit()` looks something like this:

```js
let activeTrick = null;

function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const input = $('#input').val();
  $('#input').val('');

  if (!ACTIVE_TRICK) {
    const trick = repertoire.find((t) => input.includes(t.prompt));
    if (trick) {
      ACTIVE_TRICK = trick;
      return trick.perform();
    }
  }

  const totalLines = activeTrick.patter.length;

  if (activeTrick.patterShown < totalLines) {
    activeTrick.perform();
  } else if (activeTrick.patterShown === totalLines) {
    activeTrick = null;
  }
}
```

_note: some code is omitted for clarity_

<br />
<br />
Now we just need to figure out how 'chat huh' will communicate.

## the final piece

Embarrassingly, I got the idea from this meme:
![spongemock](/images/blog/spongememe.png)

Turns out the easiest way to fake communication is by using the laziest kind: mockery.

```js
function makeMockery(phrase) {
  //returns PHrAsE
  const mockery = phrase.split('')
    .map((char) =>
      Math.random() < 0.6
        ? char.toUpperCase()
        : char.toLowerCase()
    )
    .join('');

  return mockery;
}
```

<br/>
<br/>
And one more function, to handle inputs & clean up the event handler:

```js
function getTrickorMockery(input) {
  const trick = repertoire.find((t) => input.includes(t.prompt));
  if (trick) {
    ACTIVE_TRICK = trick;
    return trick.perform();
  }

  const mockery = makeMockery(input);

  new TypeIt('#output', {
    strings: mockery,
    speed: 25,
    }).go();
}

```
In other words, unless it's prompted correctly,
'chat huh' just throws your words back at you - _mockingly_.
<br/>

## conclusion
And that's it! Now a sarcastic jerk, 'chat huh' side-stepped
the interactivity problem and was performance-ready.
Here's the [demo link](https://youtu.be/eZv5wb56MB0) again
if you'd like to see it all put together.

Granted, I've explained none of the actual "magic" involved
(did you really think I would?),
I hope this behind-the-scenes peek inspires you
to meld your own passions, encounter fun challenges,
and find quirky solutions.
