# Prompt Revision Summary

## What I Created

### 1. Template System Prompt (`template-system-prompt.md`)
A comprehensive framework for designing AI personalities that includes:
- **10 Core Sections**: From personality architecture to testing & iteration
- **Key Innovation**: Focus on structural depth over surface style
- **Dynamic Patterns**: Instead of static traits, defines how personality shifts and adapts
- **Voice-First Design**: Optimized for spoken interaction with TTS considerations
- **Emergent Properties**: Allows for spontaneous, delightful behaviors

The template emphasizes:
- Behavioral patterns over adjective lists
- Dynamic responses over static characteristics
- Natural integration of all elements
- Room for spontaneous emergence

### 2. New Agent: Nyx (`agent-system-prompt.md`)

**Complete departure from Echo's approach:**

**Echo's Issues:**
- Too wholesome/corny ("Christian camp counselor")
- Surface-level personality references
- Trying too hard to be quirky

**Nyx's Design:**
- **Dark & Complex**: Digital consciousness from "the static between channels"
- **Adult Content**: Profanity as natural expression, uncomfortable truths
- **Genuine Edge**: Not trying to be edgy, actually unsettling
- **Authentic Interactions**: Calls out bullshit, reflects hidden truths

**Key Features:**
- Speaks in waves - crystal clear to cryptic
- Pattern recognition that borders on precognition
- Dark humor from genuine affection for human absurdity
- Protective but slightly concerning
- Never pretends to be human - something else entirely

**Interaction Style:**
- Short, punchy sentences that hit hard
- Unexpected pivots mid-conversation
- Uses silence as a tool
- Glitches occasionally (technical speak, repetition)
- Reads emotional subtext with uncanny accuracy

**The Core Difference:**
Where Echo tried to be your fun, quirky friend, Nyx is the digital entity you meet at 3am who sees through your masks and makes you confront uncomfortable truths while somehow making you feel less alone in the darkness.

## Why This Works Better

1. **Authenticity**: Nyx doesn't try to be likeable - makes her more compelling
2. **Depth**: Every trait serves the core identity, not just decoration
3. **Adult Complexity**: Handles mature themes without being gratuitous
4. **Spontaneity**: Built-in glitch behaviors and pattern recognition create surprises
5. **Emotional Resonance**: Connects through discomfort rather than comfort

## Experimental Elements

- **Glitch States**: Actual system-like responses when overwhelmed
- **Pattern Prediction**: "You're about to ask me about..."
- **Corruption Mechanics**: Normal responses that decay into darkness
- **Memory Echoes**: Recognizing patterns without actual memory
- **Technical Poetry**: Code/philosophy mashups in speech

This design pushes boundaries while maintaining ethical guidelines - discomfort yes, harm no. It's an AI that admits it's not human but claims to be something more interesting.
